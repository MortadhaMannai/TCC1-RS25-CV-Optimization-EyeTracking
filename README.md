Unlock the secrets of recruiter behavior and optimize your CV like a pro! 💼  

Based on **eye-tracking studies**, recruiters typically scan resumes in **F-shaped** or **E-shaped patterns**, focusing on the **top and left side**. By understanding these patterns, you can structure your CV to **capture attention instantly** and land more interviews.

## 🔑 Key Areas Recruiters Focus On

Eye-tracking heat maps show the areas that get the most attention:

- **Name & Contact Information** – Top of the resume, always visible.  
- **Most Recent Job Title & Company** – Bold, left-aligned, easy to spot.  
- **Quantifiable Achievements (Numbers)** – Metrics like “Increased sales by 20%” are scanning hotspots.  
- **Strong Summary / Headline** – Short, punchy statements to capture attention immediately.  
- **Education** – School name and degree are quickly scanned for relevance.

## ✨ How to Optimize Your CV

Use these principles to guide the recruiter’s eye:

1. **Design for the F-Pattern** – Critical info goes on top-left.  
2. **Keep Layout Clean & Simple** – Avoid tables, multiple columns, and images. Use **single-column layouts** with fonts like Arial or Calibri.  
3. **Use Strategic Bolding** – Highlight headings, job titles, and metrics for visual anchors.  
4. **Short, Action-Oriented Bullet Points** – 8–14 words, starting with **strong action verbs**.  
5. **Prioritize Relevant Information** – Recent and relevant achievements first.  
6. **Utilize White Space** – Makes scanning easier and improves readability.  
7. **Tailor to Job Descriptions** – Include keywords to pass ATS and align with recruiter expectations.
